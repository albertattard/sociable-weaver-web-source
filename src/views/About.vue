    <p>
      As an <em>author</em> of programming blogs, or books, it is hard to make sure that the examples provided in the
      text work well. As a <em>reader</em>, it is frustrating to find halfway through that the example does not work or
      how some things ended up here and not there.
    </p>
    <p>Sociable Weaver is a platform created to solve these problems.</p>
    <h3>For the Authors</h3>
    <p>
      Blogs or books, Sociable Weaver provides a testing platform where all examples can be easily executed to make sure
      that these work as expected.
    </p>
    <h3>For the Readers</h3>
    <p>
      Sociable Weaver provides an interactive platform where all examples can be executed through the interactive web
      interface and viewed locally using the preferred IDE.
