    <h1>Sociable Weaver</h1>
    <p>
      As an author of programming blogs or books it is hard to make sure that the examples provided in the text work
      well.  As a reader, it is frustrating to find halfway through that the example does not work or how some things
      ended up here or not there.
    </p>
    <p>Sociable Weaver is a platform created to solve these problems.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>For the authors</strong> - blogs or books Sociable Weaver provides a testing platform where all examples
      can be executed to make sure that these work and produce the expected results.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>For the readers</strong> - Sociable Weaver provides an interactive platform where all examples can be
      executed through the interactive web interface and viewed locally using the preferred IDE.
